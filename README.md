## jhd - Hex Dump

jhd a kind of od(1) clone for use without
any kind of Hex or Octal Dump Utility.
This also contains some options not contained in od(1).

To build, execute build.sh to generate a Makefile from
Makefile.template on most BSD/Linux systems and IBM AIX.
For MS-DOS, it should be rather easy to create a Makefile.

This requires [j\_lib2](https://github.com/jmcunx/j_lib2) to build.

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, so I came up with my own method which
is a real hack.  But works for me.
